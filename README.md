## Final Project

### WahFi - Wireless guitar effect controller

WahFi is a wireless foot pedal that can control guitar effects such as volume and Wah. The pedal can operate remotely with a battery and uses its internal IMU to detect movements / gestures. The pedal currently can select between a Volume pedal and a Wah pedal, allowing the user to toggle, switch pedals, and control the pedal position remotely with low latency.
